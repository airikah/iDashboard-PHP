# Default Password is "iCauseFX"

## Setup
**Requirements:** A webserver (nginx, Apache, IIS or any other webserver) configured with PHP5.5 support.
`` parse_ini_file `` must be allowed in php.ini (default is allowed!)
- To set it up, clone this repository:
`` git clone https://github.com/causefx/iDashboard-PHP `` or download the ZIP-file.
- Place all files on a publically accessible webserver, either directly in the root, or inside a directory called ``Dashboard`` or whatever you want it to be called.  Please set the correct user permissions on the directory and it's files.

## INSTRUCTIONS
Upload all contents of zip or git pull the zip into the folder you want to have this on your webserver.  Set the correct file permission on the files.

Open up the index.php file once everything is uploaded.  The script will install and copy the default template over.

Now you can goto settings [Password is iCauseFX] and change the tabs to whatever you like in whatever order and change your password.

Once the cookie expires you will need to login again

If you aren't logged in you or any guest will only see your guest enabled tabs
